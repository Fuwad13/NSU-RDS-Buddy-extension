# Privacy Policy for NSU RDS Buddy Extension

*Last updated: May 19, 2025*

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how the NSU RDS Buddy browser extension works when you use our Extension. We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal data.

## Information Collection

### What We Collect

The NSU RDS Buddy Extension:

- **Does not collect personal information** from users
- **Does not transmit data** to external servers
- **Does not use tracking technologies** like cookies or web beacons
- **Only accesses and processes information locally** on your device

The Extension operates by analyzing the grade history page on the NSU RDS portal (https://rds3.northsouth.edu/students/grade_history/) to provide the following features:
- What-If CGPA Calculator
- CGPA Progression Chart

### How Information is Used

All data processing occurs exclusively within your browser. The Extension:

1. Reads your grade history data directly from the NSU RDS portal
2. Processes this information locally to generate visualizations and calculations
3. Does not store any data beyond your current browser session
4. Does not transmit your academic information to any third parties

## Data Storage

The Extension does not persistently store any user data. All calculations and visualizations are generated on-demand and are cleared when you:

- Navigate away from the NSU RDS grade history page
- Close your browser

## Third-Party Access

The NSU RDS Buddy Extension:
- Does not share any information with third parties
- Does not integrate with third-party analytics services
- Does not contain any advertising or tracking components

## User Rights

As the Extension does not collect or store personal data, there is no need for specific data access, correction, or deletion mechanisms. However, you can uninstall the extension at any time, which will completely remove any functionality of the extension.


## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on the Extension's store page.
